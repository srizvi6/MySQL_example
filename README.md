# MySQL_example

This code is for my medium article on an intro to MySQL that I used for my movie recommendation service: https://medium.com/@syeda.sr96/mysql-for-storing-and-telemetry-data-16e13e2e63a7

Simple use of MySQL for movie recommendation service ratings data.

Running the ratings_orig.py script requires the user to connect to the kafka stream which is confidential, so this code is just an example to reference for other applications.

Changing for main.
